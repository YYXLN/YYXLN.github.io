# Day 1: Introduction to LLM Infrastructure

## What is LLM Infrastructure?
LLM (Large Language Model) infrastructure refers to the systems, tools, and processes required to train, deploy, and maintain large language models like GPT.

## Key Components:
1. **Compute Resources**: High-performance GPUs/TPUs for training and inference.
2. **Data Pipeline**: Efficient data preprocessing, storage, and retrieval.
3. **Model Training**: Distributed training frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
4. **Deployment**: Scalable serving solutions like Kubernetes or serverless platforms.
5. **Monitoring**: Tools to track model performance and usage.

## Why is it Important?
LLM infrastructure ensures that models are trained efficiently, deployed reliably, and maintained effectively, enabling real-world applications.
